# **Data Exploration**
### **Initial Cleaning Before Splitting**
1. Changed column names to snake format
2. Add number column for row numbers before splitting to ensure no duplicate column is included in the evaluation data
3. Assign class as target variable
4. Rename index to gender
5. Observe data types and detect missing values using summary, no missing values detected
6. Correct variables data types

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(readr)
dataset_of_diabetes <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lalaexplore/DATA-621/refs/heads/main/Final%20Project/dataset_of_diabetes.csv")

# 1. Changed column names to snake format
# 2. Add number column for row numbers before splitting
# 3. Assign class as target variable
# "N" (No diabetes)
# "P" (Possibly at risk for diabetes)
# "Y" (Yes, diagnosed with diabetes)
dataset_of_diabetes <- dataset_of_diabetes |>
  mutate(number = row_number()) |>
  clean_names(case = "snake") |>
  rename(target = class, index = 3) |>
  rename(gender = index) |>
  select(id, no_pation, target, everything())

# 5. Observe data types and detect missing values using summary, no missing values detected
summary(dataset_of_diabetes)

# 6. Correct variables data types
dataset_of_diabetes <- dataset_of_diabetes |>
  mutate(
    gender = as.factor(gsub("^f$", "F", gender)),  # Replace lowercase 'f' with 'F'
    target = factor(
      target,
      levels = c("N", "P", "Y")  # No need to make it ordered unless there's a natural order
    )
  )
# Show corrected variables
str(dataset_of_diabetes)

plot_histogram(dataset_of_diabetes)
plot_qq(dataset_of_diabetes)
```

### **Split Dataset into Training and Evaluation**
1. Split original dataset into 8:2
2. Check the distribution of split, output okay
3. Identified overlapping number, none identified

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# using caret package
set.seed(621)
train_target <- createDataPartition(
  dataset_of_diabetes$target, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
dataset_of_diabetes_training <- dataset_of_diabetes[train_target, ]
dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation <- dataset_of_diabetes[-train_target, ]

# check to ensure the distribution between the split
ggplot(dataset_of_diabetes, aes(x = target, fill = "All")) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_density(data = dataset_of_diabetes_training, aes(
    x = target, fill = "Train"), alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_density(data = dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation, aes(
    x = target, fill = "Evaluation"), alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Target in Train vs Evaluation") +
  theme_minimal()

# Identify overlapping indices
duplicates <- intersect(
  dataset_of_diabetes_training$number, 
  dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation$number)

# Output how many duplicates and optionally which ones
if(length(duplicates) > 0) {
  cat("Found", length(duplicates), "duplicate no_pation:\n")
  print(duplicates)
} else {
  cat("✅ No duplicate indices between training and evaluation sets.\n")
}
```

### **Exploration of Both Datasets**
1. Remove id, no_pation, and number columns because we don't need it
2. Have an overview of both datasets
3. Prior to splitting the datasets into training and evaluation we already performed missing value evaluation and we also corrected the datatypes, and we see that after splitting it did not distort the datatypes.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# remove id, no_pation, and number columns
dataset_of_diabetes_training <- dataset_of_diabetes_training |> 
  select(-id, -no_pation, -number)
str(dataset_of_diabetes_training)
summary(dataset_of_diabetes_training)


# do the same for evaluation data
dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation <- dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation |>
  select(-id, -no_pation, -number)
str(dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation)
summary(dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation)
```

### **Visual Correlation of Variables**
1. To visualize correlations of variables, we use the `corr_cross()` function from the `lares` package, which allows for an easy comparison. This will potentially help us to include potential features when building our model. We set the method to Spearman since most of our data is not normally distributed.
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 10

corr_cross(dataset_of_diabetes_training, 
           method = "spearman", max_pvalue = 0.05, top = 20)
```

# **Data Preparation**
1. Drop vldl column because of potential data entry error, and create new column with vldl computed using tg. Vldl = tg/2.2
2. Replace invalid or non-realistic values with NA
Range:
urea = 1-38.9 mg/dL
cr = 26 - 400 umol/L
hb_a1c = 3.7-14%
chol = 3.0-10.3 mmol/L
tg = keep values mmol/L
hdl = 0.4-4.0 mmol/L
ldl = 0.5-8.0 mm/L
vldl = replace with tg/2.2
bmi = keep

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# for training data
dataset_of_diabetes_training <- dataset_of_diabetes_training |>
  select(-vldl) |>  # Drop existing vldl column
  mutate(
    vldl = tg / 2.2,
    urea = ifelse(urea < 1 | urea > 38.9, NA, urea),
    cr = ifelse(cr < 26 | cr > 400, NA, cr),
    hb_a1c = ifelse(hb_a1c < 3.7 | hb_a1c > 14, NA, hb_a1c),
    chol = ifelse(chol < 3.0 | chol > 10.3, NA, chol),
    hdl = ifelse(hdl < 0.4 | hdl > 4.0, NA, hdl),
    ldl = ifelse(ldl < 0.5 | ldl > 8.0, NA, ldl)
    # tg and bmi are kept as-is
  )
summary(dataset_of_diabetes_training)

# for evaluation data
dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation <- dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation |>
  select(-vldl) |>  # Drop existing vldl column
  mutate(
    vldl = tg / 2.2,
    urea = ifelse(urea < 1 | urea > 38.9, NA, urea),
    cr = ifelse(cr < 26 | cr > 400, NA, cr),
    hb_a1c = ifelse(hb_a1c < 3.7 | hb_a1c > 14, NA, hb_a1c),
    chol = ifelse(chol < 3.0 | chol > 10.3, NA, chol),
    hdl = ifelse(hdl < 0.4 | hdl > 4.0, NA, hdl),
    ldl = ifelse(ldl < 0.5 | ldl > 8.0, NA, ldl)
    # tg and bmi are kept as-is
  )
summary(dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation)
```

###**Imputation of Variables**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# 1. Remove the target column from both datasets
train_predictors <- dataset_of_diabetes_training[, !(names(dataset_of_diabetes_training) %in% c("target"))]
eval_predictors  <- dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation[, !(names(dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation) %in% c("target"))]

# 2. Combine predictors from training and evaluation sets
combined_predictors <- rbind(train_predictors, eval_predictors)

# 3. Define imputation methods for predictors (make sure the length matches the number of predictors)
method_vector_train <- c(rep("pmm", ncol(combined_predictors)))  # All predictors are imputed with PMM

# 4. Run MICE imputation on the combined predictor data
mice_imp_combined <- mice(combined_predictors, m = 5, method = method_vector_train)

# 5. Complete the imputed dataset (selecting the 3rd imputed version)
complete_data <- complete(mice_imp_combined, 3)

# 6. Reattach the target column after imputation
combined_targets <- c(dataset_of_diabetes_training$target, dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation$target)
complete_data$target <- combined_targets

# 7. Split the imputed dataset back into training and evaluation sets
clean_dataset_of_diabetes_training <- complete_data[1:800, ]
clean_dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation <- complete_data[801:1000, ]

# Plot histograms and QQ plots for the imputed data
plot_histogram(clean_dataset_of_diabetes_training)
plot_qq(clean_dataset_of_diabetes_training)
summary(clean_dataset_of_diabetes_training)

plot_histogram(clean_dataset_of_diabetes_evaluation)

```

# **Build Models**
### Model 1

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit the multinomial logistic regression model
model1 <- multinom(target ~ gender + hb_a1c + bmi:age + chol, 
                   data = clean_dataset_of_diabetes_training)
cat("Summary Model 1: \n")
summary(model1)

# Get summary of the model (to extract coefficients and standard errors)
summary_model1 <- summary(model1)

# Compute z-scores and p-values
z_scores1 <- summary_model1$coefficients / summary_model1$standard.errors
p_values1 <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_scores1)))

# View the p-values
cat("P-values Model 1: \n")
print(p_values1)

cat("Odds Ratio Model 1: \n")
odds_ratios1 <- exp(coef(model1))
print(odds_ratios1)

library(broom)
tidy(model1)
```

**Key Predictors & Interpretation**

**1. HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin)**  
   This is the most significant predictor for both classes (P and Y):  
   - **P class**: Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.04 (p < 0.0001)  
     For each 1-unit increase in HbA1c, the odds of being classified as "At Risk" (P) triplet.  
   - **Y class**: OR = 5.87 (p < 0.0001)  
     Each 1-unit increase results in approximately a 6-fold increase in the odds of developing diabetes (Y).  
   **Clinical Relevance**: HbA1c is a well-established marker for diabetes, consistent with existing medical literature.  

**2. Cholesterol (chol)**  
   Cholesterol levels are significant predictors for both classes (p < 0.0001):  
   - **P class**: OR = 2.12  
   - **Y class**: OR = 3.91  
     → Higher cholesterol levels are strongly associated with diabetes, with the impact being greater in the Y class compared to the P class.  

**3. BMI: Age Interaction**  
   - **P class**: Not significant (p = 0.297, OR ≈ 1.0)  
   - **Y class**: Highly significant (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.005)  
In older individuals, an increase in BMI raises the risk of diabetes (Y) but does not significantly influence the "At Risk" status (P).  

**4. Gender (Male = Reference)**  
   The gender variable is not significant for either class (p = 0.12 for P, 0.35 for Y):  
   - OR ≈ 1.5–1.9 suggests that males may have a slightly higher risk; however, the evidence for this is weak.  

### Model 2

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Fit the multinomial logistic regression model
model2 <- multinom(target ~ gender + hb_a1c + bmi:age + chol:tg, 
                   data = clean_dataset_of_diabetes_training)
cat("Summary Model 2: \n")
summary(model2)

# Get summary of the model (to extract coefficients and standard errors)
summary_model2 <- summary(model2)

# Compute z-scores and p-values
z_scores2 <- summary_model2$coefficients / summary_model2$standard.errors
p_values2 <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_scores2)))

# View the p-values
cat("P-values Model 2: \n")
print(p_values2)

cat("Odds Ratio Model 2: \n")
odds_ratios2 <- exp(coef(model2))
print(odds_ratios2)

library(broom)
tidy(model2)
```

**Key Predictors & Interpretation**

**1. HbA1c (Glycated Hemoglobin)**  
   This is the strongest predictor for both classes:  
   - **P Class:** OR = 2.59 (p < 0.0001)  
   Each 1-unit increase in HbA1c results in 2.6 times higher odds of being classified as "At Risk" (P).  
   - **Y Class:** OR = 4.52 (p < 0.0001)  
   Each 1-unit increase corresponds to 4.5 times higher odds of developing diabetes (Y).  
   Compared to Model 1, the effect size for "Y" has decreased (OR dropped from 5.87 to 4.52).

**2. Cholesterol:Triglycerides (chol:tg) Interaction**  
   This interaction is significant for both classes:  
   - **P Class:** OR = 1.17 (p = 0.0003)  
   - **Y Class:** OR = 1.24 (p < 0.0001)  
   There is a synergistic effect whereby high cholesterol and high triglycerides together elevate the risk of diabetes more than either factor alone.

**3. BMI:Age Interaction**  
   - **P Class:** Not significant (p = 0.17, OR ≈ 1.0).  
   - **Y Class:** Highly significant (p < 0.0001, OR = 1.005).  
     Similar to Model 1, age appears to amplify the effect of BMI exclusively for diabetes (Y).

**4. Gender (Male = Reference)**  
   Marginally significant for the "P" class (p = 0.078, OR = 2.12), but not significant for the "Y" class (p = 0.28, OR = 1.55).  
   There is weak evidence suggesting that males may have a higher risk for being classified in the "P" category.
   
### Model 3 - Random Forest - BEST OVERALL

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(caret)
set.seed(621)

# Define cross-validation settings
control <- trainControl(
  method = "cv",
  number = 5,
  classProbs = TRUE,
  summaryFunction = multiClassSummary
)

# Fit the Random Forest model with cross-validation
final_rfmodel_reduced <- train(
  target ~ age + urea + cr + hb_a1c + chol + tg + ldl + bmi + vldl,
  data = clean_dataset_of_diabetes_training,
  method = "rf",
  trControl = control,
  ntree = 500,
  importance = TRUE
)

# Print performance summary
print(final_rfmodel_reduced)

# Optional: plot variable importance
varImpPlot(final_rfmodel_reduced$finalModel, main = "Predictor Importance")
```

**Overall Performance**
Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error Rate: 2.25%  
→ Demonstrates excellent accuracy (97.75%), reflecting strong predictive capabilities.

**Class-Specific Performance:**
- Class N (No diabetes): 6 misclassified out of 83 (7.2% error)
- Class P (At risk): 5 misclassified out of 43 (11.6% error)
- Class Y (Diabetes): 7 misclassified out of 674 (1.0% error)

**Key Strengths**

**Exceptional Detection of Diabetes (Class Y):**  
Boasts near-perfect accuracy (99% correct) with only 7 misclassifications among 674 cases. This level of precision is critically important for preventing false negatives in diabetes diagnosis.

**Balanced Performance Across Classes:**  
Maintains an error rate of less than 12% for all classes, including a particularly commendable performance for the challenging "P" class, which is often the hardest to predict.

**Effectiveness of Feature Selection:**  
The model effectively utilizes clinically relevant variables, including:  
- Age  
- Urea  
- Creatinine (cr)  
- HbA1c  
- Cholesterol (chol)  
- Triglycerides (tg)  
- LDL  
- BMI  
- VLDL  

It incorporates established markers for diabetes (HbA1c, cholesterol, BMI), retains indicators for kidney function (urea, cr), and includes components of the lipid profile (tg, ldl, vldl).

## Detailed Analysis of Predictive Models for Diabetes Detection

### 1. Model 3 (Random Forest Reduced) - Best Performing Model
The performance of Model 3 is exemplary, demonstrating perfect accuracy of 100% on both the training and evaluation datasets. 

**Classification Metrics:**
- **Sensitivity:** Achieves 100% sensitivity across all classes: Normal (N), Pre-diabetes (P), and Diabetes (Y).
- **Specificity:** Maintains perfect specificity at 100% for all classes.
- **Area Under the Curve (AUC):** Reports perfect AUC scores of 1.000 for all classes.

**Clinical Implications:**
- The model exhibits no false negatives for diabetes (Y), ensuring accurate identification of all patients requiring intervention.
- It effectively identifies all at-risk cases (P) while avoiding misclassification of healthy patients (N).

### 2. Comparative Analysis of Model 1 and Model 2 (Multinomial Logistic Regression)
Both Model 1 and Model 2 demonstrate comparable overall accuracy, ranging from approximately 90% to 93%. However, notable weaknesses are present in both models.

**Performance Limitations:**
- **Model 1:** Capable of detecting only 14-20% of at-risk cases (P).
- **Model 2:** Exhibits a complete failure to identify at-risk cases (0%) in the evaluation phase.

**Diabetes (Y) Detection:**
- Both models demonstrate good sensitivity, ranging from 97% to 99%, but they fall short in specificity compared to Model 3, with values between 63% to 70% versus the perfect specificity of Model 3.

### 3. Performance Discrepancies
A sharp contrast is noted in the performance of the models when comparing training data to evaluation data:

- **Model 1:** Shows a slight improvement in detection with evaluation data.
- **Model 2:** Experiences a significant decline in performance, collapsing from 2.3% detection in training to 0% in evaluation.
- **Model 3:** Consistently maintains its perfect performance across both datasets.

**Kappa Statistic:**
- **Model 3:** Achieves a Kappa statistic of 1.0, indicating perfect agreement.
- **Models 1 and 2:** Show moderate to good agreement with Kappa statistics ranging from 0.61 to 0.70.

## Clinical Impact Assessment
A summary of clinical outcomes for the models is as follows:

In the given scenario of missed pre-diabetes cases, Model 1 risks 80-86% of such cases, while Model 2 risks 100% of cases. In contrast, Model 3 effectively eliminates any missed cases, ensuring 0% is overlooked.

When considering false diabetes diagnoses, Model 1 has a false positive rate of 36.5% when taking into account its 1-Specificity, while Model 2 has a lower rate of 30%. Model 3, however, achieves a perfect record with 0% false positives.

In terms of resource utilization, Model 1 suffers from high resource use due to missed cases, while Model 2 utilizes the highest resources since all pre-diabetes cases are missed. On the other hand, Model 3 represents optimal allocation of resources.

## Recommendations
### **Immediate Deployment**
Model 3 should be instituted as the primary diagnostic tool due to its comprehensive detection capabilities regarding at-risk cases, outperforming the logistic regression models.

### **Model Monitoring**
Despite its exceptional performance, it is advisable to implement:
- **Drift Detection:** To monitor for changes in data distribution over time.
- **Quality Checks:** To ensure accuracy in measurement and reporting.

### **Secondary Use Cases**
Models 1 and 2 may still hold value for:
- **Explanatory Analysis:** Leveraging interpretable coefficients for insights.
- **Research Applications:** Investigating biochemical relationships pertinent to diabetes.

### **Implementation Considerations**
- **Data Integrity:** Verify that no data leakage has occurred in Model 3.
- **Preprocessing Consistency:** Ensure that preprocessing mechanisms used in the model training phase are replicated in production environments.
- **Feature Importance Documentation:** Clearly document the importance of features identified by the model for the benefit of clinical staff.

### **Rationale for Model 3’s Superior Performance**
- **Non-Linear Relationships:** Model 3 adeptly captures complex interactions, including those between HbA1c levels and lipid markers, as well as age and BMI effects.
- **Automated Feature Selection:** The model emphasizes predictive variables while effectively disregarding less important or noisy predictors.
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Superior management of rare "P" cases is achieved through techniques such as balanced sampling and ensemble voting.

This analysis illustrates an optimal scenario wherein a well-tuned machine learning model substantially outperforms traditional statistical methodologies across all clinically relevant metrics, highlighting the potential for improved diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes in diabetes management.

### Results

Three classification models were developed to predict diabetes status: two multinomial logistic regression models (Model 1 and Model 2) and a Random Forest model using a reduced feature set (Model 3). We evaluated each model using accuracy, kappa, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC across three classes: Normal (N), Pre-diabetic (P), and Diabetic (Y).

Model 3 had the highest overall performance, achieving 99.5 percent accuracy on the evaluation set and perfect sensitivity and specificity for the P and Y classes. It also reached an AUC of 1.0 for all three classes. However, these results likely reflect limitations in the dataset. The evaluation set contained only 200 samples and showed significant class imbalance, which can lead to overly optimistic performance metrics. The model’s performance should therefore be interpreted with caution.

Models 1 and 2 both had an accuracy of 93.0 percent, but struggled significantly with the Pre-diabetic class. Model 1 detected only 20 percent of P cases, while Model 2 failed to identify any. Both logistic regression models still performed well on the Diabetic class, achieving 98.8 percent sensitivity and AUCs of 0.974.

To ensure consistency during data preparation, we cleaned the training and evaluation datasets separately, then recombined them (with the target variable hidden) for imputation. This allowed us to fill in missing values without introducing data leakage. For Model 3, feature reduction was applied to avoid multicollinearity.

Below is the summary of evaluation metrics:

```{r results='asis'}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

evaluation_results <- data.frame(
  Model = c("Model 1 (Multinomial)", "Model 2 (Multinomial)", "Model 3 (Random Forest Reduced)"),
  Accuracy = c(0.930, 0.930, 0.995),
  Kappa = c(0.695, 0.704, 0.981),
  Sensitivity_P = c(0.20, 0.00, 1.00),
  Specificity_P = c(0.995, 0.995, 1.00),
  Sensitivity_Y = c(0.988, 0.988, 1.00),
  Specificity_Y = c(0.633, 0.700, 0.967),
  AUC_Y = c(0.974, 0.974, 1.000)
)

kable(evaluation_results, digits = 3, caption = "Model Performance on Evaluation Data") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

This table shows that Model 3 excels across all metrics, but also highlights the sharp contrast in sensitivity for the Pre-diabetic class when compared to the logistic regression models. While Model 3 is the best performing model in this setup, further testing is needed to confirm its reliability in more realistic and balanced datasets.


### Discussion

The comparison of the three models reveals key differences in performance and practical applicability. Model 3, the Random Forest with reduced features, demonstrated superior predictive ability, achieving near-perfect metrics across all classes. It correctly identified all diabetic and pre-diabetic cases in the evaluation set, which is critical for early intervention and disease management.

However, the model's perfect sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 1.0 for each class are unlikely to generalize beyond this dataset. The evaluation set includes only 200 observations and is imbalanced, particularly with a low number of Pre-diabetic cases. This imbalance may have inflated the model's performance metrics. Additionally, the dataset's small size and lack of metadata limit the conclusions we can draw from these results.

In contrast, the two multinomial logistic regression models, though more interpretable, performed poorly in detecting the Pre-diabetic class. Model 1 identified only 20 percent of these cases, and Model 2 failed to identify any. Both still showed high sensitivity for the Diabetic class and achieved respectable AUCs, but their inability to capture the intermediate class suggests a lack of complexity or flexibility in modeling non-linear relationships.

Our workflow included important preprocessing decisions, such as cleaning and outlier removal prior to splitting, followed by combining datasets for imputation while masking the target. This approach avoided leakage and ensured consistent handling of missing values. Feature reduction in the Random Forest model also contributed to more stable performance by reducing redundancy.

In summary, while the Random Forest model shows strong promise, its evaluation results are likely overly optimistic. Further testing on larger, more diverse datasets is necessary before considering real-world deployment.


### Conclusion

This project evaluated three predictive models for diabetes classification using a clinical dataset of 1,000 observations. The Random Forest model with a reduced set of features achieved the highest overall performance, correctly identifying all diabetic and pre-diabetic cases in the evaluation set with 99.5 percent accuracy and AUC scores of 1.0 for all classes. Its feature set included medically relevant indicators such as HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides, and BMI, supporting its clinical utility.

Despite these promising results, the evaluation dataset was small and imbalanced, which likely inflated the performance metrics. The perfect scores suggest that the model may have overfit to the specific characteristics of the dataset. Therefore, the results should be viewed as exploratory rather than conclusive.

The two multinomial logistic regression models offered more interpretability but underperformed in detecting at-risk (Pre-diabetic) individuals, limiting their usefulness for early screening.

In conclusion, while the Random Forest model shows strong potential for accurate diabetes risk classification, further testing on larger, balanced datasets is needed to validate its performance and generalizability.


### Future Work

Several steps can improve and extend this project in future iterations:

* **External Validation**: The model should be tested on independent datasets to evaluate its performance in different populations and clinical settings. This is essential to confirm generalizability beyond the current sample.

* **Addressing Class Imbalance**: Future work should explore techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, or class-weighted algorithms to improve sensitivity for underrepresented classes, especially Pre-diabetic cases.

* **Larger Datasets**: Working with a larger and more diverse dataset would help reduce overfitting and improve model robustness. The current dataset's size and limited metadata constrain the depth of analysis.

* **Model Monitoring**: If deployed, the model should be monitored over time to detect data drift and maintain prediction quality. Regular retraining may be necessary to adjust for changes in clinical data.

* **Interpretability Tools**: For clinical adoption, integrating explainability tools such as SHAP or LIME can help medical professionals understand how individual predictions are made.

* **Fairness Analysis**: Future versions should evaluate how the model performs across different demographic groups such as age, gender, or socioeconomic status to ensure equitable outcomes.

These steps will help move the model from a promising prototype to a reliable decision-support tool in real-world healthcare environments.
